# iOS Swift Training
This repository will be used for training iOS programming using Swift and UI patterns. Some examples may be simple, but they are used to learn the guidelines of the platform.
<br><br>
Codes are made using a Hackintosh with a i5-7200U and 8GB of RAM.

## UIKit
**Hello World:** is an sign in options screen that let the user chose between logging in with Google, Facebook or E-mail. It was developed to train buttons, fields, constraints and autolayout.
<br><br>
**Stack View:** similar to Hello World, it presents to the user sign in options in a scren. However, different of the Hello World example, this one use a stack view for constraining the buttons on the screen.
<br><br>
**WarCard:** this app presents some functions of Xcode like putting elements on a new Stack View. It has a card game template, though it's not functional.
<br><br>
**WarCard v2:** in this version of WarCard, I learned how to use some tools to debug the code. I also leaned how to connect storyboard elements with the viewController code and deal with user taps.
## SwiftUI

## Playgroud
Here we have some codes for praticing concepts of Swift programming, object-oriented programming and Coursera exercises to train Swift concepts learned in the course.
