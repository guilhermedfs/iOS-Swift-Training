 ### Exercise
 
 Create a series of variables and constants that represent a driver's license or passport.  You might include properies such as:
 
 1.  dateOfBirth
 2.  age
 3.  isOrganDonor
 4.  streetAddress
 5.  city
 6.  state
 7.  zip / postal code
 8.  idNumber
 9. etc
 
 After you have created the properties, create a string variable that contains all of the data from the other variables/constants and then print it into a single readable sentance.
 
 The final output might look similar to this:  "Hi, my name is Jill and I was born on 12/20/80 and I live at 224 Worthington drive and my id number is..." etc etc
 
 Be sure to include all of the properties.

let dateOfBirth = "12/10/2000"
var myAge = 21
var isOrganDonor = "yes"
var streetAdress = "Recanto das Emas"
var city = "Bras√≠lia"
var state = "DF"
let idNumber = 2213090
var phoneNumber = 0990101
let cpfNumber = 00000000001
let name = "Guilherme"

var finalString = "Hi, my name is \(name), I'm \(age) old. I live at \(streetAdress), \(city) - \(state). My ID number is: \(idNumber). My CPF number is: \(cpfNumber). My phone number is (00)\(phoneNumber). "
