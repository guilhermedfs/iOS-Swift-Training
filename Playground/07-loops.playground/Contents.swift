 ### Exercise
 
 Consider a banking system where the computer stores transactional data for a customer's account.
 
 1.  Create an array of Double that stores the amounts of ten past purchases
 2.  Create a loop that iterates through the array and prints the amount spent with this formatting: `"Purchase: $X"` where X is the amount of the purchase
 3.  The bank improperly calculated the purchases. Create a *different* loop style that iterates through the array and and adds $0.10 to each purchase amount then print the array
 4.  Create a loop that iterates through the array starting at the *end* of the array and going to the beginning
